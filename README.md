# DyphanBot
DyphanBot is an [open-source](https://github.com/buzzbyte/DyphanBot)
extensible bot software for [Discord](https://discordapp.com) with plugin
support and custom per-server extensions. It is currently in early stages of
development and not ready to be used in the wild just yet.

This website is currently used to host DyphanBot extension manifests, and
other related `.json` files, under `/repo`.
